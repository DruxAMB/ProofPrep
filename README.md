## Problem Statement

Traditional interview preparation methods often fall short in several ways:

1. **Lack of Realism**: Reading interview questions and preparing answers doesn't simulate the pressure of a real interview.
2. **No Immediate Feedback**: Practice with friends or mentors doesn't provide objective, consistent feedback.
3. **Limited Accessibility**: Professional interview coaching is expensive and not accessible to everyone.
4. **Difficulty Tracking Progress**: Most preparation methods don't offer a way to measure improvement over time.
5. **Industry-Specific Preparation**: Different roles require different preparation approaches.

## Solution

ProofPrep addresses these challenges by:
